## [1.9.1] — Orphaned statistics cleanup, reverse-proxy detection & translations

### Added
- **German translation + completed locales (#47):** added a full German (`de`) translation and
  brought the existing Spanish, Russian, Slovak and Brazilian-Portuguese files back to full
  parity with English (they were missing ~43% of strings, including the whole options flow and
  the Repairs texts). A new CI check now validates every locale against `en.json` (keys +
  `{count}`/`{port}` placeholders) so they can't drift again.
- **Reverse-proxy / SSO detection (#45, #46):** when the WebSocket handshake is intercepted by a
  reverse proxy or SSO portal (e.g. Cloudflare Access), setup now shows a clear
  *"intercepted by a reverse proxy or SSO portal"* message instead of a misleading
  *"invalid API key"* / *"unknown error"*.

### Fixed
- **Orphaned long-term statistics can now be cleaned up (#44):** after an entity-id rename the
  recorder can leave the old `sensor.truenas_*` statistics behind (they show as "no state
  available" in *Developer Tools → Statistics*). The integration now detects these each poll
  and surfaces a **Repairs** issue (Fix → delete, or Ignore) plus a diagnostic
  **"Clean up orphaned statistics"** button that is available whenever orphans exist.
- **Orphan detection now covers custom instance names (#48):** statistics from an instance whose
  name slug merges the domain into a longer token (e.g. `sensor.truenasviacfnoauth_*`) are now
  recognised too, so the cleanup button no longer stays greyed out for them.
- **Host field accepts pasted URLs (#45, #46):** a leading `https://`, a path or a trailing slash
  in the *Host* field are now stripped automatically instead of failing the setup.

### Documentation
- **Reverse proxies & required permissions (#45):** README now documents that the integration
  must reach the TrueNAS host directly (LAN/VPN) — an auth gateway in front of it cannot be
  bypassed — and that the API key's user needs the appropriate role. The Translation section was
  updated to reflect that translations are maintained directly in this repository.

## [1.9.0] — Run buttons, action descriptions & robustness

### Added
- **Run buttons (new `button` platform):** one-tap **Run** buttons for snapshot, rsync,
  replication and cloudsync tasks appear on each task's device page — no need to call an
  action from Developer Tools or build a button card.
- **`snapshottask_run` action:** run a periodic snapshot task on demand (target the
  snapshot task sensor), mirroring `rsync_run` / `replication_run`.
- **Instant run feedback:** triggering a snapshot / rsync / replication / cloudsync run
  (via button or action) now optimistically sets the sensor to `RUNNING` right away, so a
  fast task that finishes between two polls still shows the trigger worked; the next regular
  poll re-syncs to the real TrueNAS state.

### Fixed
- **Action descriptions now show up in Home Assistant:** the descriptions lived in
  `actions.yaml`, which Home Assistant does not read — it reads `services.yaml` (which was
  empty since the 1.4.1 rename). All action names, descriptions and fields are now defined in
  `services.yaml`, so they appear in *Developer Tools → Actions*. Dead `jail_*` entries were
  dropped and `dataset_snapshot` got a clearer display name ("Create dataset snapshot").
- **Clear error for unsupported actions:** targeting an action at an entity type that does not
  support it (e.g. `service_restart` on an app) now raises a descriptive error instead of a
  bare "Unknown error".
- **No more `KeyError` crashes on a transient API hiccup:** when a query times out / the
  WebSocket changes mid-query and a data group is briefly emptied, entities now degrade to an
  unknown state instead of raising `KeyError` while writing their state.

### Documentation
- New **Actions** reference table in the README. Added notes that a fast replication/snapshot
  run may finish within the poll interval and therefore not surface the transient `RUNNING`
  state (the persistent state always matches the WebUI).

## [1.8.1] — Multi-instance unique-ID fix

### Fixed
- **Unique-ID error spam with multiple TrueNAS instances (#33):** With more than one
  TrueNAS config entry, the global entity-discovery dispatcher signal made every
  instance's platform also try to create the *other* instance's entities, flooding the
  log with `Platform truenas does not generate unique IDs … already exists` (endlessly,
  since the rejected entities never enter the platform and are retried each refresh).
  Each platform now ignores refreshes coming from other config entries.
  Single-instance setups were unaffected.

## [1.8.0] — Directory Services

### Added
- **Directory Services (#22):** Monitor the TrueNAS Directory Services connection
  (Active Directory / LDAP / IPA) via the unified `directoryservices.*` API
  (TrueNAS 25.04+). A connectivity binary sensor reports whether the service is
  healthy, and a companion status sensor exposes the raw state (`HEALTHY`,
  `FAULTED`, …). Domain, Kerberos realm, site, account-cache and DNS-update
  settings are exposed as attributes. The entity only appears when a directory
  service is actually configured and enabled. New monitored group
  **Directory Services** (enabled by default).

---

## [1.7.0] — TrueNAS Containers + Restart Actions

### Added
- **Containers (#26):** Each TrueNAS Container (Incus instance) is a binary sensor
  (running on/off) with type, status, CPU, memory, autostart, image and IP address
  attributes, grouped under their own device.
- **Start / Stop / Restart** actions for containers (`container_start/stop/restart`,
  `virt.instance.*`); the live state is checked before start/stop.
- **`vm_restart`** action — VMs and containers now share the same start/stop/restart trio.

### Changed
- Robust entity discovery: the "seen" set is derived from the platform's live
  entities (recreate on startup, no re-add spam, runtime-removed objects reappear).
- Monitored-group checks use shared constants; container CPU normalized to a number;
  virt stop options centralized; mis-shaped API responses are logged.

## [1.6.1] — Stability: Entity Spam, Blocking Call & Replication State

### Fixed
- Entities no longer stuck `unavailable` on startup (late fix to the #33 discovery rework).
- No more "non-unique ID" log spam (#33): discovery adds only genuinely new entities.
- No blocking call in the event loop (#33): the WebSocket SSL context is built lazily.
- Replication task state (#34): read from the task's persistent `state` object
  (matching the WebUI), with the last job's state as a fallback.

## [1.6.0] — Options Flow, Live Interface Values & Masked Credentials

### Added
- **Options flow (#14):** Configure under *Settings → Devices & Services → TrueNAS →
  Configure*, applied immediately via reload — poll interval (5/10/30/60/120/300 s),
  monitored groups, behaviour toggles (skip disabled cronjobs, hide RX/TX for
  disconnected NICs) and the GB/GiB data-size unit.

### Changed
- Live interface throughput averaged over a window matching the poll interval.
- Empty devices are cleaned up when a group/interface is removed.
- Disabling a group skips its API query entirely.

### Security
- API key field is now a masked password input (setup + reconfigure).

## [1.5.5] — Hotfix: Phantom App Image Update

### Fixed
- Phantom "Update available" for catalog apps (#31): the `image_updates_available`
  fallback is now correctly gated on `custom_app`, so catalog apps rely solely on
  `upgrade_available` (matching TrueNAS' own state).

## [1.5.4] — Network Group, Boot-Pool & Task Actions

### Added
- Dedicated **"TrueNAS Network"** device for per-interface RX/TX sensors (#25).
- Per-interface link connectivity binary sensor (up/down), even for down interfaces.
- Boot-pool exposed as a regular pool via `boot.get_state` (#23).
- Status sensors for each rsync task in a dedicated **"Rsync tasks"** group (#16).
- `rsync_run` and `replication_run` on-demand actions, guarded against running jobs (#16).

### Changed
- Automatic orphan cleanup of entities whose TrueNAS object no longer exists
  (transient empty fetches never wipe a group; skipped unless the last update succeeded).
- `get_systeminfo` runs before the concurrent jobs, so the first poll has correct values.
- All GitHub Actions pinned to commit SHAs, least-privilege permissions, off Node.js 20.

### Notes
- Closed as not feasible: UPS power/energy + full NUT variables (#17) and SMART test
  results (#15) are not exposed by the TrueNAS JSON-RPC API.

## [1.5.3] — ARC & raidz Fixes, Live Entity Discovery

### Added
- Live entity discovery: new objects appear automatically without a reload.

### Fixed
- ARC sensor no longer stuck at 0; corrected size/allocated for raidz pools.
- Traffic sensors hidden for interfaces whose link is down; null-safe pool totals.

## [1.5.2] — Pool Capacity, UPS Sensors & Auto-Scaled Units

### Added
- Pool capacity sensors (free / size / allocated).
- UPS monitoring: charge, runtime, load, voltage, current, frequency, temperature.
- Auto-scaled data-size units (MB/GB/TB/PB or MiB/GiB/TiB/PiB) per GB/GiB preference.

### Changed
- Pool figures derived from the root dataset, matching the UI for raidz layouts.
- Modern SSL context defaults; generic default host (removed hardcoded IP).
- `system_uptime` uses the `UPTIME` device class; CI moved to Node.js 24.

## [1.5.1] — Cloudsync Control, Disk Health & Stability

### Added
- Cloudsync start/stop switch entities.
- Per-disk health sensor.

### Changed
- Hardened WebSocket layer; fixed leaked connections; more defensive API parsing.

## [1.5.0] — Massive Core Overhaul & New Features

### Added
- TrueNAS Alerts diagnostic sensor (messages + severity).
- SMB connections diagnostic sensor.
- Setup auto-discovery of the TrueNAS IP via local DNS.

### Changed
- Migrated to the modern TrueNAS DDP WebSocket protocol (`auth.login_with_api_key`).
- Pre-flight TCP port check (IPv6-ready) and smarter handshake/query timeouts.
- Dual-lock thread-safety (`_lock` + `_io_lock`); exception-type-based error handling.

### Fixed
- Service controls use modern `service.start/stop/restart/reload`.
- Robust version parsing; reduced stat-graph log spam; entity naming via
  `_attr_has_entity_name`; redundant read-only service binary sensors disabled by default.

### Notes
- Minimum TrueNAS version raised to **25.04** (modernized WebSocket API).

## [1.4.2] — Logic Fixes & API Stability

### Fixed
- RPC errors now preserve detailed backend context in the logs.
- Snapshot fallback (`pool.snapshot.create` → `zfs.snapshot.create`) triggers correctly.
- `cronjob_skip_disabled` is respected during updates.
- Fixed a mutable default-argument bug in the API query method.

## [1.4.1] — TrueNAS SCALE 25.10 & HA 2024.8+ Compatibility

### Changed
- Migrated `services.yaml` → `actions.yaml` (HA "Services" → "Actions").
- Minimum Home Assistant version: **2024.8.0**.
- Replaced Flake8/Black with **Ruff**; native Bandit security checks; cleaned CI.

### Fixed
- Handle JSON-RPC parsing errors to prevent crashes on unexpected API formats.
- Modern type hints and `.get()` fallbacks to avoid `KeyError` crashes.
