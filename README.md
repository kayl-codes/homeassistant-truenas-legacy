# Features
## Pools
Monitor status for each TrueNAS pool.

![Pools Health](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kayl-codes/homeassistant-truenas/master/docs/assets/images/ui/pool_healthy.png)
![Pools Free Space](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kayl-codes/homeassistant-truenas/master/docs/assets/images/ui/pool_free.png)

## Datasets
Monitor usage and attributes for each TrueNAS dataset.

![Datasets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kayl-codes/homeassistant-truenas/master/docs/assets/images/ui/dataset.png)

> **Datasets** is a monitored group (enabled by default). You can disable it under
> *Settings → Devices & Services → TrueNAS → Configure → Monitored groups*.

## Disks
Monitor temperature and attributes for each TrueNAS disk.

![Disks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kayl-codes/homeassistant-truenas/master/docs/assets/images/ui/disk.png)

## Network
Each network interface is grouped under its own dedicated device. The integration
exposes RX/TX traffic sensors and a link connectivity binary sensor per interface.
Traffic sensors are created for active interfaces; the link sensor is always
available so disconnected interfaces can be monitored too. Sensors for interfaces
that no longer exist are cleaned up automatically on startup.

![Network](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kayl-codes/homeassistant-truenas/master/docs/assets/images/ui/network.png)

## Virtual Machines
Control and monitor status and attributes for each TrueNAS virtual machine.
Start, stop and restart are available through the `vm_start`, `vm_stop` and `vm_restart` actions.

![Virtual Machines](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kayl-codes/homeassistant-truenas/master/docs/assets/images/ui/vm.png)

> **Virtual Machines** is a monitored group (enabled by default). You can disable it under
> *Settings → Devices & Services → TrueNAS → Configure → Monitored groups*.

## Containers
Monitor each TrueNAS **Container** (Incus instance, TrueNAS 25.04+) as a binary sensor,
with type, status, CPU, memory, autostart, image and IP address as attributes.
Start, stop and restart are available through the `container_start`, `container_stop`
and `container_restart` actions (target the container's binary sensor).

> **Containers** is a monitored group (enabled by default). You can disable it under
> *Settings → Devices & Services → TrueNAS → Configure → Monitored groups*.
> On an existing install, enable **Containers** once after upgrading.
>
> Note: a restart is a background job, so the brief down-state may not be sampled by the
> poll — the steady state is always reported correctly.

## Cloudsync
Control and monitor status and attributes for each TrueNAS cloudsync task.
Cloudsync control is available through actions.

![Cloudsync](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kayl-codes/homeassistant-truenas/master/docs/assets/images/ui/cloudsync.png)

> **Cloudsync** is a monitored group (enabled by default). You can disable it under
> *Settings → Devices & Services → TrueNAS → Configure → Monitored groups*.

## Replication Tasks
Monitor status and attributes for each TrueNAS replication task.
Replication tasks can be started on demand through the `replication_run` action.

![Replication Tasks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kayl-codes/homeassistant-truenas/master/docs/assets/images/ui/replication.png)

> **Replication** is a monitored group (enabled by default). You can disable it under
> *Settings → Devices & Services → TrueNAS → Configure → Monitored groups*.
>
> Note: triggering a run on demand (the **Run** button or `replication_run`) shows
> `RUNNING` immediately and re-syncs to the real state on the next poll. A **scheduled**
> run that finishes between two polls may only be sampled in its final state (e.g.
> `FINISHED`) — the persistent state always matches the TrueNAS WebUI.

## Rsync Tasks
Monitor status and attributes for each TrueNAS rsync task.
Rsync tasks can be started on demand through the `rsync_run` action.

> **Rsync Tasks** is a monitored group (enabled by default). You can disable it under
> *Settings → Devices & Services → TrueNAS → Configure → Monitored groups*.

## Snapshot Tasks
Monitor status and attributes for each TrueNAS snapshot task.
Periodic snapshot tasks can be started on demand through the `snapshottask_run` action
(target the snapshot task sensor).

![Snapshot Tasks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kayl-codes/homeassistant-truenas/master/docs/assets/images/ui/snapshottask.png)

> **Snapshot Tasks** is a monitored group (enabled by default). You can disable it under
> *Settings → Devices & Services → TrueNAS → Configure → Monitored groups*.
>
> Note: triggering a run on demand (the **Run** button or `snapshottask_run`) shows
> `RUNNING` immediately and re-syncs to the real state on the next poll. A **scheduled**
> run that finishes between two polls may only be sampled in its final `state` (e.g.
> `FINISHED`); the task's `datetime` / last snapshot is the reliable run evidence —
> TrueNAS itself shows no live "running" feedback for these tasks either.

## Dataset Snapshot
Create an **on-demand** ZFS snapshot of a dataset through the `dataset_snapshot` action
(target a dataset sensor) — taken immediately, independent of any periodic snapshot task.
The snapshot name is generated automatically in ISO datetime format with microseconds and
a `custom-` prefix.

![Snapshot UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kayl-codes/homeassistant-truenas/master/docs/assets/images/ui/snapshot_ui.png)
![Snapshot YAML](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kayl-codes/homeassistant-truenas/master/docs/assets/images/ui/snapshot_yaml.png)

## Services
Control and monitor status and attributes for each TrueNAS service.
Service control is available through actions.

![Services](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kayl-codes/homeassistant-truenas/master/docs/assets/images/ui/service_1.png)
![Services Control](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kayl-codes/homeassistant-truenas/master/docs/assets/images/ui/service_2.png)

## Directory Services
Monitor the TrueNAS **Directory Services** connection (Active Directory, LDAP or IPA;
TrueNAS 25.04+ unified API). A connectivity binary sensor reports whether the directory
service is **healthy**, and a companion status sensor exposes the raw state
(`HEALTHY`, `FAULTED`, …). Domain, Kerberos realm, site, account-cache and DNS-update
settings are available as attributes.

The entity only appears when a directory service is actually configured and enabled,
so systems without AD/LDAP get no entity.

> **Directory Services** is a monitored group (enabled by default). You can disable it under
> *Settings → Devices & Services → TrueNAS → Configure → Monitored groups*.

## Diagnostics
Monitor overall system health and active alerts directly from the device page. The integration provides a dedicated diagnostic sensor that automatically detects any disk or pool issues.

![Diagnostics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kayl-codes/homeassistant-truenas/master/docs/assets/images/ui/diagnostics.png)

## Reboot and Shutdown
Reboot or shut down a TrueNAS system.
Power control is available through actions.
Target system uptime sensor.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36953052/221521930-f8f789e6-deec-4cc2-b11e-740caa056e44.png)

## Actions
All actions are prefixed with `truenas.` and **target a specific entity** (the one whose
TrueNAS object they act on). Each action has a name and description in
*Developer Tools → Actions*.

| Action | Target entity | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `vm_start` · `vm_stop` · `vm_restart` | VM binary sensor | Start / stop / restart a virtual machine (`vm_start` has an optional `overcommit` field) |
| `container_start` · `container_stop` · `container_restart` | Container binary sensor | Start / stop / restart a container (Incus instance) |
| `app_start` · `app_stop` | App binary sensor | Start / stop an app |
| `service_start` · `service_stop` · `service_restart` · `service_reload` | Service binary sensor | Control a TrueNAS service |
| `cloudsync_run` · `cloudsync_abort` | Cloudsync sensor | Start / abort a cloudsync job |
| `replication_run` | Replication sensor | Start a replication task on demand |
| `rsync_run` | Rsync task sensor | Start an rsync task on demand |
| `snapshottask_run` | Snapshot task sensor | Run a periodic snapshot task now |
| `dataset_snapshot` | Dataset sensor | Create an immediate `custom-<timestamp>` snapshot of a dataset |
| `system_reboot` · `system_shutdown` | Uptime sensor | Reboot / shut down the TrueNAS system |

Example:
```yaml
action: truenas.dataset_snapshot
target:
  entity_id: sensor.truenas_<host>_<dataset>
```

> **Run buttons:** snapshot, rsync, replication and cloudsync tasks also expose a one-tap
> **Run** button on their device page, so you can trigger them without calling an action.

# Install integration from Custom Repository
1. Open HACS, click the 3-dot menu in the upper right corner and select **Custom repositories**.
2. Add the following details:
   * **Repository:** `https://github.com/kayl-codes/homeassistant-truenas.git`
   * **Category:** Integration
3. Click **Add** and download the integration.
4. Restart Home Assistant (full restart, not quick reload).
5. Navigate to **Settings -> Devices & services -> Add Integration** and search for **TrueNAS**.


Minimum requirements:
* TrueNAS 25.04
* Home Assistant 2024.8.0

## Using TrueNAS development branch
If you are using development branch for TrueNAS, some features may stop working.

## Setup integration
1. Create an API key for Home Assistant on your TrueNAS system.

![Setup step 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kayl-codes/homeassistant-truenas/master/docs/assets/images/ui/setup_1.png)
![Setup step 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kayl-codes/homeassistant-truenas/master/docs/assets/images/ui/setup_2.png)
![Setup step 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kayl-codes/homeassistant-truenas/master/docs/assets/images/ui/setup_3.png)

> **⚠️ Required permissions.** On TrueNAS 25.04+ an API key is [tied to a user account](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/toptoolbar/managingapikeys/) and inherits that user's privileges, so the integration can only do what the user's role allows. This integration needs **administrative** access: besides reading system/pool/dataset/app data it also performs control actions (reboot/shutdown, start/stop VMs, apps and services, run tasks), which require write privileges across the API. The key's user therefore needs **TrueNAS Access** enabled with the **Full Admin** role (`FULL_ADMIN` grants unrestricted access to every API method). A key whose user has TrueNAS Access disabled, or only a restricted role, will fail to log in **even though the key itself is valid** (this is the usual cause of a *"Login failed, invalid API key"* error with a brand-new key). If you want to scope the key down instead, the [Role-Based Access Control reference](https://api.truenas.com/v25.10/rbac.html) — in particular its *Predefined Group Roles* table — documents exactly what each role can do. The screenshot below shows a dedicated `HomeAssistant` user with Full Admin access.

![Setup step 4 – required user access](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kayl-codes/homeassistant-truenas/master/docs/assets/images/ui/setup_4.png)

2. Setup this integration for your TrueNAS device in Home Assistant via `Configuration -> Integrations -> Add -> TrueNAS`.
You can add this integration several times for different devices.

NOTES: 
- If you dont see "TrueNAS" integration, clear your browser cache.

![Add Integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kayl-codes/homeassistant-truenas/master/docs/assets/images/ui/setup_integration.png)
* "Name of the integration" - Friendly name for this router
* "Host" - The TrueNAS hostname or IP address. Best is a bare host such as `192.168.100.100` (a non-standard port may be appended with a colon, e.g. `192.168.100.100:8888`). If you paste a full URL, any scheme (`https://`) and path are stripped automatically.
* "API key" - TrueNAS API key for Home Assistant (see the required permissions note above)
* "Data size unit" - Choose how storage sizes are displayed. You can select between **GB** (Gigabytes, base 1000) and **GiB** (Gibibytes, base 1024). This will automatically adjust all dataset, pool, and memory sensors.

### Remote access, reverse proxies & Cloudflare

The integration talks to TrueNAS over its JSON-RPC **WebSocket** API (`wss://<host>/websocket`), which has a few consequences for how you can reach TrueNAS:

* **Use the local IP (or local DNS name) — this works best and is recommended.** Home Assistant and TrueNAS usually sit on the same network, so a local address keeps the traffic entirely local: it does *not* leave to the internet and come back in through a proxy/CDN, which means lower latency, no external dependency and nothing for an auth gateway to intercept. A **VPN** (e.g. WireGuard/Tailscale) achieves the same when HA runs off-site. Of the two, a **plain IP address is the safest choice**, because it removes name resolution from the equation — intermittent DNS/hostname-lookup failures do happen and have been observed in the HA log, and an IP simply cannot hit them.
* **A plain reverse proxy works** (TLS termination only, no authentication) as long as it forwards the WebSocket upgrade and the `/websocket` path untouched. Use a certificate valid for the hostname and keep **Verify SSL certificate** enabled.
* **An authentication gateway in front of TrueNAS does _not_ work** — for example **Cloudflare Access / Zero Trust**, Authelia, or HTTP basic-auth. These intercept the WebSocket handshake and redirect it to a login page (HTTP 302) or reject it (401/403) *before it ever reaches TrueNAS*, so the API key never gets a chance to authenticate. A headless integration cannot complete an interactive SSO login, so this is a hard limitation, not a bug. The integration detects this and reports it clearly instead of a generic error.
  * If you must reach TrueNAS through such a gateway, add a **bypass / service-token policy for the `/websocket` endpoint** so that path skips the interactive login — or simply use the LAN/VPN address instead.

## Options

After setup you can fine-tune the integration via **Settings → Devices & Services → TrueNAS → Configure**. Saving the options reloads the integration so changes take effect immediately.

* **Poll interval** - How often TrueNAS is queried: `5`, `10`, `30`, `60` (default), `120` or `300` seconds. Lower values give near-live network throughput; higher values reduce load on TrueNAS. Interface RX/TX is averaged over the selected interval.
* **Data size unit** - `GB` (base 1000) or `GiB` (base 1024); applied to all dataset, pool and memory sensors.
* **Behaviour**
  * *Skip disabled cronjobs* - hide cronjobs that are disabled in TrueNAS (on by default).
  * *Hide RX/TX sensors for disconnected NICs* - when enabled, traffic sensors are only created for connected interfaces; when disabled (default), every interface gets RX/TX sensors.
* **Monitored groups** - Enable or disable whole sensor groups: **UPS**, **Virtual Machines**, **Containers**, **Cloudsync**, **Replication**, **Rsync Tasks**, **Snapshot Tasks**, **Datasets** and **Directory Services**. Disabling a group skips its API query entirely (saving resources) and removes its entities and device from Home Assistant on the next reload. Core groups (system, network, pools, disks, apps, services, alerts) are always monitored.
